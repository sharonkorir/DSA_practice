# DSA Practice

Repository for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice, focusing on LeetCode problems.

## Purpose

Track and improve DSA skills, with an emphasis on array problems.



## Structure

- **`arrays/`**: Array problems using techniques like Sliding Window.
- **`strings/`**: String problems.
- **`heaps/`**: Heap-based problems.
- **`techniques/`**: Notes on array techniques.
- **`notes/`**: General DSA resources.

Files: `[number]_[problem_name].py` (e.g., `001_longest_substring_without_repeating.py`).

## Array Techniques

- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Traversing from Right
- Sorting
- Pre-computation

See `techniques/` for details.
