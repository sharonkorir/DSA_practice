# Arrays

Solutions to array-based Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, primarily from LeetCode.

## Purpose

Practice and document array problems, focusing on techniques like Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Traversing from Right, Sorting, and Pre-computation.

## Problems

- [001] Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Sliding Window, Two Pointers

## Techniques

- **Sliding Window**: Optimizes subarray problems by reducing nested loops.
- **Two Pointers**: Generalizes Sliding Window, often used for sorting or partitioning.
- **Traversing from Right**: Useful for problems like monotonic stacks.
- **Sorting**: Common in interval or binary search problems.
- **Pre-computation**: Uses prefix sums or products for efficient calculations.

See `../techniques/` for detailed notes.

## Usage

Run a solution:

```bash
python 001_longest_substring_without_repeating.py
```
